## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Asset Lending & Borrowing**: Deposit ETH or USDC to earn interest, or use them as collateral to borrow other assets.
-   **Cross-Collateral Borrowing**: Flexibility to borrow ETH using USDC collateral, or borrow USDC using ETH collateral.
-   **Real-Time Validation**: Comprehensive checks for user balance, pool liquidity, and borrowing/withdrawal limits *before* transactions are submitted.
-   **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Competitive lending (5% ETH, 4% USDC) and borrowing (8% ETH, 6% USDC) APYs.
-   **Chainlink Oracle Integration**: Utilizes Chainlink ETH/USD price feeds for accurate, real-time collateral valuation and health factor calculations.
-   **Inline Transaction Status**: Provides clear, contextual feedback on transaction progress (pending, success, error) directly within the interface, eliminating disruptive popups.
-   **Advanced Limit Management**: Displays maximum borrowable and withdrawable amounts, along with required collateral, updated in real-time.
-   **Liquidity Buffer**: Maintains a configurable buffer (e.g., 0.03 ETH, 30 USDC) in the lending pool to ensure continuous liquidity for withdrawals.
-   **Health Factor Monitoring**: Users can track the health of their loans to avoid liquidation.
-   **Secure Protocol**: Built with industry-standard OpenZeppelin contracts for reentrancy protection, ownership, and pausability.
-   **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
-   npm (v8.x or higher)
-   MetaMask browser extension installed
-   Arbitrum Sepolia testnet ETH (for gas fees and testing)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Agihtaws/arbminidefi.git
    cd arbminidefi
    ```

2.  **Install root dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Smart Contract Deployment**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your private key and Arbitrum Sepolia RPC URL:
        ```
        PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY"
        ARB_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"
        ```
    *   Compile and deploy the `MultiAssetLendingPool` contract:
        ```bash
        npx hardhat clean
        npx hardhat compile
        npx hardhat run scripts/deployMultiAsset.js --network arbitrumSepolia
        ```
    *   **Note the deployed `MultiAssetLendingPool` address and update it in `frontend/src/contracts/config.ts`**. The USDC token address is already configured.

4.  **Frontend Setup**:
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    *   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Getting Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet ETH
